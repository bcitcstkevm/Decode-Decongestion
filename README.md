# Decode-Decongestion - Bike2Go
This repository hosts Good Warm Up's Code for the Decode Congestion Hackathon - Bike2Go.
Here we allow the user to click between two points on a map and experience a bike ride virtually.
Along the way we present hazards and possible dangers.
The vision here is to encourage people who are afraid of biking to immerse themselves in a virtual biking experience. 
Hopefully by going through this experience the user will feel more confident on the road and will be driven to bike more.

As a side result, we would pull people off cars and promote alternative means of transportation.
